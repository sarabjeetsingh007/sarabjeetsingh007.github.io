I am a third year PhD stuent at The University of Utah, working under the supervision of [Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/) in the [Utah Arch Research Group](https://arch.cs.utah.edu/). My research interests are broadly in the areas of hardware security and at the intersection of computer architecure and Post Quantum Security. Particularly, my work focuses on designing efficient memory integrity verification and hardware acceleration of lattice-based cryptography, ranging from Key establishments to Secure Machine Learning as a Service using Homomorphic Encryption.
