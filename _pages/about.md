I am a third year PhD stuent at The University of Utah, working under the supervision of [Prof. Rajeev Balasubramonian](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/) in the [Utah Arch Research Group](https://arch.cs.utah.edu/). My research interests are broadly in the areas of Hardware Security and at the intersection of Computer Architecure and Post Quantum Security. Particularly, my work focuses on designing *efficient memory integrity verification* and *hardware acceleration of lattice-based cryptography*, ranging from Key Establishments to Secure Machine Learning as a Service using Homomorphic Encryption.
