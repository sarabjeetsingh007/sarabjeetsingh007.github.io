PANE : Pluggable Asynchronous Network-on-Chip Simulator
======
PANE, Pluggable Asynchronous Network-on-Chip, is a simulator  that supports modeling and analysis of synchronous, asynchronous and mixed synchronous-asynchronous NoCs. It allows easy modeling for a variety of NoC designs with different topologies, routing algorithms, allocation and arbitration mechanisms, buffering schemes and workloads. PANEâ€™s design allows for simulation of separate, yet interacting implementations of the data, routing-control and timing-control paths of the NoC. Full paper listed under Publications.

PANE code is available [here](https://github.com/sarabjeetsingh007/PANE). If you use PANE in your research, we would appreciate a citation to "Sneha N Ved, Sarabjeet Singh, Joycee Mekie, "PANE: Pluggable Asynchronous Network-on-Chip Simulator", ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC)".
